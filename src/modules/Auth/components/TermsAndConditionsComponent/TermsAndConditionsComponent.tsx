        version of the Terms of Use says and what a translation says, then the

      <div className={styles.subTitle}>User Account Creation & Security</div>
      <p>
        Elore allows users to create an account (“User Account”) by providing
        certain information to us. If you choose or are assigned a username,
        password, or similar credentials as part of our security procedures, you
        agree to treat this information as confidential. You must promptly
        notify us of any unauthorized access or use of your username or
        password, as well as any other security breaches. We reserve the right
        to disable any username, password, or other identifier, whether selected
        by you or assigned by us, at any time if we believe you have violated
        any provision of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a User Account is necessary to access certain features of
        Elore. To set up your account, you will need to provide personal
        information, including but not limited to your name, email address, and
        password, which will be collected and maintained in accordance with our
        Privacy Policies. During the account setup process, you may also be
        prompted to enter additional information, such as your date of birth and
        location, to help us tailor our services to your needs. Once your User
        Account is successfully created, you may customize your profile page as
        permitted by Elore. However, you must comply with any mandatory User
        Account settings as instructed by Elore to fully utilize your account.
        Failure to adhere to these requirements may result in restricted access
        to Elore's features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon successful creation of your User Account, you will log in using
        your username and password, which will grant you access to all
        subscribed services and features on Elore. You agree not to share your
        User Account details; any sharing is done at your own risk. You are
        responsible for ensuring that all information provided for your User
        Account is accurate, current, and complete, and you will update it as
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are fully responsible for your User Account and any activities that
        occur within it, including any harm or damage caused by its use, whether
        authorized or unauthorized. You must keep your login credentials
        confidential and protect them from disclosure. Sharing your account
        details is generally prohibited; however, if you do so, you will be
        liable for any consequences arising from this action, and Elore will not
        be involved in disputes resulting from such disclosures. You shall
        indemnify Elore against any claims arising from your failure to
        safeguard your account credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you suspect that someone else is using your account without
        permission, you must notify us immediately at contact@mesol.me. We will
        provide reasonable assistance to recover your account, for which your
        cooperation will be required.

        All rights of Mesol not explicitly addressed herein are expressly
        reserved. These Terms do not prejudice any other rights or remedies
        available to Mesol, all of which are preserved. Any actions taken by
        Mesol in accordance with applicable laws, even if not specifically

      <div className={styles.subTitle}>Other Miscellaneous Terms</div>
      <p>
        <strong>Severability:</strong> To the extent possible, each provision of
        these Terms shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be, effective
        and valid under Applicable Law. However, in the circumstances if any of
        the provisions under these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable
        with respect to certain aspects or circumstances, it shall nevertheless
        remain in full force and effect in all other aspects and circumstances.
        In the circumstance any of the provision of these Terms is deemed to be
        invalid and contrary to law by a final, binding judgement, then such
        provision shall be deemed severed from these Terms, but every other
        provision hereof shall remain in full force and effect. MESOL may with
        respect to such severed provision include any other substitute provision
        reflecting the original intent of MESOL as that of the severed provision
        and such substitute provision shall be deemed to be part of these Terms
        to the extent permissible under the Applicable Law.
